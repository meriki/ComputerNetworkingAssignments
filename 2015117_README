Server-Client Application in Java

To run the above two java files:
Server - 
javac Server_2015117.java 
java Server_2015117 port_number_of_server
Client -
javac Client_2015117.java 
java Client_2015117 port_number_of_server

(if port number as argument is not specified server and client will run at default port 6665)

Server:
	In the main thread of the server, the server binds to a socket. After that, in a while loop it keeps checking if any client wants to connect. If a client has requested connection, server accepts and launches a thread as associates with it a number.
Client:
	The client establishes a connection and activates two threads - Listen and Send to implement a full duplex connection with the server.

The format is as follows - 
Client a: Message
Client a,b: Message
List All

The format is space and case sensitive.
